## About

### Introduction

Today, especially when the world lies in the grasps of the Corona-virus, a considerable chunk of information exchange happens in the form of **online chat conversations**.

Such conversations involve a substantial amount of participants and a single conversation tends to span a wide range of topics interspersed with irrelevant segments. This results in the necessity of having proper **summarization**, so that people who were not present during a long (not necessarily coherent) conversation need not read through the big chain of chats to follow-up on it and can rather read a summary of the same, thus saving a lot of time.

This calls for summarization algorithms that work on scraped data from chat services and yield a summary as required.

### About Discord

Among the several instant messaging platforms available, **Discord** is one of the most popular ones. Because of its several innovative features like server-channel systems, awesome call quality, permission management and tools to integrate bots, Discord has become a major platform for people to collaborate, converse and share ideas.

### Our Idea

In this project, we aim to make a **Discord bot** that effectively *summarizes* conversations and allows the user to keep a *record* of these summaries (in an as required basis) on a dedicated website.

This not only allows the user to obtain a **automated-summary** of any given chain of chats, but also allows the user to have easy access to these stored summaries for future reference.
